** Blockchain-Based Academic Certificate Verification System

1.Project Overview
This project is designed to prevent academic certificate fraud using blockchain technology. It provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system for storing and verifying certificates.
2. Features
-  Secure certificate storage using blockchain
-  Tamper-proof data (cannot be modified)
-  Instant certificate verification
-  Decentralized and transparent system
-  Prevents fake certificates

3. Technologies Used
- Blockchain (Hyperledger / Ethereum)
- Smart Contracts
- Node.js / Java / Python (Backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- IPFS (for file storage)

4.How It Works
1. Institution uploads certificate details to blockchain
2. Certificate data is stored securely as a block
3. A unique hash/ID is generated for each certificate
4. Users can verify certificates using the hash
5. System checks blockchain and shows authenticity
